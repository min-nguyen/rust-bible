// # LIFETIMES
//
// Lifetimes, a property of references, are another kind of generic.
//
// Recall lifetimes:
//
//    The lifetime of a reference is the span of time in which it is used and guaranteed to point to a valid value.
//
// Most of the time, lifetimes are implicit and inferred, just like most of the time, types are inferred.
// We must annotate lifetimes of references when they could be related in different ways, just like we must annotate types when multiple types are possible.
