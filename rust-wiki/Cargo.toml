# Crates can depend on other libraries from crates.io or other registries, git repositories, or subdirectories on your local file system.
[dependencies]

# In Rust, a library or executable program is called a crate. Crates are compiled and executed using the Rust compiler, rustc.
# Rather than work only with crates and rustc, we can work with the Cargo as the Rust package manager.
# Cargo does four things:
#  1. Introduces two metadata files with various bits of package information.
#  2. Fetches and builds your packageâ€™s dependencies.
#  3. Invokes rustc or another build tool with the correct parameters to build your package.
#  4. Introduces conventions to make working with Rust packages easier.

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html
