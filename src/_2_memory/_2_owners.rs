// # OWNERS
//
// The Three Rules of Ownership:
//  1. Each Value Has a Single Owner.
//     That is, each value is owned by a single variable.
//  2. When the Owner Goes Out of Scope, the Value Is Freed.
//       For values on the stack, this is managed trivially by the stack pointer.
//       For values on the heap, Rust automatically *drop*s the memory associated with the value.
//  3. Ownership Can Be Transferred (Moved).
//     The original variable becomes invalid, and the new variable becomes the owner of the data.
//
// A variable that owns data means it mabages the actual value.
// This may mean:
//   1) It directly stores the actual value, or
//   2) It indirectly owns the underlying value, by storing the
//      information of wherever the value was allocated.
//      This means it stores:
        //  a.  A pointer to the data
        //  and depending on the type of data, may also store:
        //  b.  A length
        //  c.  A capacity
//

fn owner_example() {
  // x owns 42, directly on the stack
  let x = 42;
  // y owns the Vec, indirectly allocated on the heap
  let y: Vec<i32> = Vec::from([1,2,3]);
}
  // An Informal Mental Model of what *COULD* happen:
  // STACK:
  // +-----------------------------------------+
  // | Stack Frame: owner_heap                 |
  // +-----------------------------------------+ 0x7ffeefbff4a0
  // | x: 42                                   | 4 bytes
  // +-----------------------------------------+ 0x7ffeefbff4a4
  // | y: Vec { ptr: 0x60004230,               | 8 bytes
  // |          len: 3,                        | 8 bytes
  // |          capacity: 12,                  | 8 bytes
  // | }                                       |
  // +-----------------------------------------+
  // HEAP:
  // +-----------------------------------------+ 0x60004230
  // | [1, 2, 3]                               | 12 bytes
  // +-----------------------------------------+

// ## Ownership Scope and Dropping:
//
// Variable Scope:
// A local variable's scope normally coincides with the "{}" syntax, such as the end of a block or function.
//
// Dropping:
// Each heap allocation must be paired with exactly one free when weâ€™re done with it.
// Heap memory is automatically freed once its owner goes out of scope, and is done via a special function "drop".
//
//
fn ownership_scope_example(){
    {
        // The variable s owns a string, allocated on the heap
        let s: String = String::from("hello"); // <<-- s is valid from this point forward
    } // <<-- s goes out of scope (and is no longer valid), and its data is dropped
}

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ## Ownership Transfer: Moving, Copying, and Cloning Data
//
// Ownership transfer is an abstract concept that allows one to assign (=) a value stored in one variable to another to create a new owner.
// Depending on the type of value being assigned.,the transfer can be labelled a MOVE, COPY, or CLONE.
// (By abstract, transferring ownership doesn't necessarily do anything in memory at all. A MOVE may perform a copy in memory, and a COPY may not copy anything. These details are entirely up to the compiler.)
//
//   a. A MOVE happens by default unless the assigned value implements the Copy trait.
//      This can be understood as:
//        - The value stored in the original variable is "moved" to the new variable.
//        - If the value indirectly manages data (usually on the heap), that data is not duplicated.
//        - The original variable is invalidated, and the new variable owns the data.
//
//   b. A COPY happens if the assigned value implements the Copy trait.
//      Only applies to variables not indirectly managing data (usually on the heap).
//      This can be understood as:
//        - The value stored in the original variable is "copied" to the new variable.
//        - Both the original and new variables remain valid and own independent copies of the same value.
//
//   c. A CLONE happens if the assigned value is a result of clone().
//      Only applies to variables indirectly managing data (usually on the heap).
//      This can be understood as:
//       - The value stored in the original variable is "copied" to the new variable,
//         but points to a newly allocated memory region.
//       - The data that the value pointed to is "cloned" to the new region.
//       - Both the original and new variables remain valid and own independent copies of the same data.

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ## Mental Model: Ownership Transfer in practice.
//
// Ownership transfer is an abstract concept, and it is not usually productive to think of how it happens in memory.
// That is, transferring ownership doesn't necessarily do anything in memory at all.
// Semantically, all MOVE, COPY, and CLONE perform a memcpy i.e. an actual copy in memory.
// In practice, a memcpy won't happen unless necessary, and the optimiser can do anything as long as it does not change the behaviour of your program.
//
//  - A MOVE may or may not copy the same value on the stack.
      // - For example, below COULD produce two copies of USER on the stack.
                        // struct User {
                        //   active: bool,
                        //   sign_in_count: u64,
                        // }
                        // fn structs_ownership(){
                        //   let user1 = User {
                        //     active: true,
                        //     sign_in_count: 1,
                        //   };
                        //   let user2 = user1;
                        // }
// - A COPY may or may not copy the same value on the stack.
            // - For example, below COULD reduce to one user on the stack, and both `user2` and `user1` refer to the same address on the stack
                        // #[derive(Clone, Copy)]
                        // struct User {
                        //   active: bool,
                        //   sign_in_count: u64,
                        // }
                        // fn structs_ownership(){
                        //   let user1 = User {
                        //     active: true,
                        //     sign_in_count: 1,
                        //   };
                        //   let user2 = user1;
                        // }
// - A CLONE may or may not copy the same value on the stack, and may or may not copy the same value on the heap.
//
// Having a mental model where every copy is a new value stored is fine, as long as you don't use this mental model to reason about performance.

// ## OWNERSHIP TRANSFER in FUNCTION CALLS
//
// Passing a value as a function argument will transfer ownership exactly like when a value is assigned to a variable.

    // The following line works fine as x never became invalid.
    println!("{}", x);
} // <<-- Both x and s are out of scope (and invalid).
  //      Because s's ownership was already moved, there is nothing to drop.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) {   // <<-- some_string is valid hereon

// ### OWNERSHIP TRANSFER in FUNCTION RETURNS
//
// Returning a value from a function can also transfer ownership.

fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String { // <<-- a_string is valid hereon
